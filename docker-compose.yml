    # Initialise a Mongo cluster with a replicaset of 1 node.
    # Based on https://medium.com/workleap/the-only-local-mongodb-replica-set-with-docker-compose-guide-youll-ever-need-2f0b74dd8384
    # Since we are using transactions, we require a replicaset. Local dev with docker compose uses 1 node below, but our live
    # environments have multiple nodes.
    # The replicaset needs initialising, so the healthcheck can be hijacked to initialise this so that it can keep retrying
    # until the operation is successful (might need to wait a while after container boot for this to work, hence the interval/retries)
    # WARNING: do not turn on authentication, otherwise will need to deal with generating key pairs and sharing them between
    # the replicaset nodes. For local development this is overkill, so just turn off auth and connect to Mongo without creds.
